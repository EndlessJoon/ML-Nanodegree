## I. Definition


### Project Overview
When graduate schools decide to get new entrants, they consider many records of the applicants including undergraduate GPA, GRE, TOEFL, letters of recommendation and so on. From the Data Science and Machine Learning point of view, by analyzing the admission data and training that, we can make a prediction model to help applicants to concentrate on more important factors which lead them to get the acceptance. 


### Problem Statement
The problem is : "How much I can have confidence that I can get the acceptance from graduate school with my record?" The record includes GPA, GRE score, TOEFL score, and so on.     
The confidence is expressed as a number in range [0, 1]. That is, we can think the confidence as the probability of getting  the acceptance.  
The solution to the problem is the confidence level that the applicants can expect for the graduate admission. The confidence level is a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) so the applicants can think of this as the probability that he or she can get the admission with his or her records(GRE score, TOEFL score,...). I will attempt to solve this problem with various regression models including linear regression, decistion tree, random forest and so on. Furthurmore, I will also try to apply classification algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes.


### Metrics
There are many metrics to measure performance of regression problem including RMSE, MAE, R squared and so on:
 * RMSE(Root Mean Square Error): This measures the standard deviation of the errors the system makes in its predictions. Smaller is better.
 * MAE(Mean Absolote Error): This measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Itâ€™s the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.
 * R squared(Coefficient of Determination): This is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Larger is better.  

There are many discussions about which metric is better for many circumstances. Actually, in my project there will not be big difference on which metric I choose so I can use any of them at this time, but I chose RMSE because I want to take precision first, penalize large prediction errors more and computationally simple metric. Although MAE is also computationally simple and easy to understand, RMSE penalize large errors more than MAE.(I've referred to this article: https://medium.com/human-in-a-machine-world/mae-and-rmse-which-metric-is-better-e60ac3bde13d)  Compared to R squared, RMSE is better option for a metric with the 'precision-first' objective. (My reference about this: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/04/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-1.html)  

Secondly, I benchmarked a few classification algorithms so I need another metric suitable for comparing classification models. As for regression models, there are many metrics for classification models including AUC-ROC Curve, Log loss, F-Beta score, F1 score, an so on.  
Among them I will use F1 score as a metric because it is commonly used for many classification problems and easy to understand. (Actually, I have more knowledge and experience in F1 score than another metrics. )  
F1 Score is harmonic mean of precision and recall. That is, F1 = 2*precision*recall / (precision + recall)  
'Precision' is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier.  
'Recall' is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive).  
(For more detail, please refer to these links:https://medium.com/thalus-ai/performance-metrics-for-classification-problems-in-machine-learning-part-i-b085d432082b  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) 


## II. Analysis


### Data Exploration
&nbsp;I used Graduate Admission dataset from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)  
This dataset contains 9 parameters:
* Serial No. (1 to 500)
* GRE Scores (290 to 340)
* TOEFL Scores (92 to 120)
* University Rating (1 to 5)
* Statement of Purpose (1 to 5)
* Letter of Recommendation Strength (1 to 5)
* Undergraduate CGPA (6.8 to 9.92)
* Research Experience (0 or 1)
* Chance of Admit (0.34 to 0.97)

Let's see some real data in this dataset to have a sense for how the raw data look:
> &gt; admission.head()

|Serial No.|GRE Score|TOEFL Score|University Rating|SOP|LOR|CGPA|Research|Chance of Admit|
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|1|337|118|4|4.5|4.5|9.65|1|0.92|
|2|324|107|4|4.0|4.5|8.87|1|0.76|
|3|316|104|3|3.0|3.5|8.00|1|0.72|
|4|322|110|3|3.5|2.5|8.67|1|0.80|
|5|314|103|2|2.0|3.0|8.21|0|0.65|

&nbsp;I'll set 'Chance of Admit' parameter as the label and the remaining parameters as inputs to make a prediction model. Serial No. will be dropped in making the model because it is simply used for indexing purpose.
As I showed in the jupyter notebook ("capstone.ipynb") this set has 500 entries, all variables are numeric (there is no categorical variable) and missing values or abnormalities about data were not found.
Let's look at summary statistics of variables to get overall picture of data:
![dd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7s0pb9of0nwo5iw/dd.JPG?dl=1) 
We can see every variable has 500 entries so there is no missing value in the dataset. And from the mean, standard deviation and the other statistics we can expect there are not abnomalities we should take care of before building up the prediction model. Lastly, when we look at GRE Score and TOEFL Score, they are mostly three-digit numbers. But the other variables are one-digit numbers. This means we need some data preprocessing like scaling to get better model.



### Exploratory Visualization
By plotting some variables we can have more in-depth understanding of each variable as well as the relationship among the variables.
[Fig 1] shows the distribution of our target variable, 'Chance of Admit'.  
We can see that most applicants think that their chance of admit is over 60% and the largest portion is in 60~80% range.  
![Fig1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9xy4525m7uwx88g/hist_CofA.png?dl=1)  
Let's look at one more distribution.  
[Fig 2] shows the distribution of TOEFL Score. We can see that most applicants have scores over 100. (pretty high-level applicants)  
![Fig2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8hvt98afcot19zy/hist_Toefl.png?dl=1)

Congregated histogram of all variables is here:
![hist_all](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzn8o9b3lk6dmyw/hist_all.png?dl=1)

Now, let's see the relations between some variables.  
We can see the relationship between TOEFL Score and CGPA in [Fig 3].  
![Fig3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zusg1v44rvgkf93/TOEFL_CGPA.png?dl=1)
This scatter plot shows that CGPA is positively related to TOEFL Score. In other words, the applicants who have high CGPA also tend to have high TOEFL Score and vise versa.  
We can find the most important features which are higly correlated to the target with following code:
> corr_matrix = admission.corr()
> corr_matrix["Chance of Admit "].sort_values(ascending=False)

|Feature|Corr|
|:--------:|:--------:|
|Chance of Admit|1.000000|
|CGPA|0.882413|
|GRE Score|0.810351|
|TOEFL Score|0.792228|
|University Rating|0.690132|
|SOP|0.684137|
|LOR|0.645365|
|Research|0.545871|
|Serial No.|0.008505|
In this table, 'Corr' represents the strength of relationship between each feature and the target ('Chance of Admit'). Corr can take a number (-1, 1), if Corr is close to -1 it means they are negatively related, or if Corr is close to 0, it means they are not related, or if Corr is close to 1 it means they are positively related.

Now we know that top three important variables which are highly related to the target variable ('Chance of Admit') are CGPA, GRE Score, and TOEFL Score. 
We can see the correlations among them by plotting the correlation matrix:
![corr_matrix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/frcn7b2d1dc6w8q/corr_matrix.png?dl=1)


### Algorithms and Techniques
For the regression problem like this, there are many algorithms which show good performance, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and so on.  
Let's look at each algorithm briefly:

[ Linear Regression ]
* Linear Regression establishes a relationship between dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X) using a best fit straight line (also known as regression line).
* It is represented by an equation Y=a+b*X + e, where a is intercept, b is slope of the line and e is error term. This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable based on given predictor variable(s).
* Pros: easy to undertand, simple to implement and very fast
* Cons: There must be linear relationship between independent and dependent variables. It is very sensitive to Outliers. It can terribly affect the regression line and eventually the forecasted values. 

Though choosing anyone would be good I chose Linear Regression because it is simple, easy to implement and understand. For the other algorithms I used them as benchmarks.  
When I used Linear Regression algorithm, I used "Chance of Admit" as a dependent(target) variable, and the others as independent(input) variables. I implemented all these in the jupyter notebook. ("capstone.ipynb")


### Benchmark

I benchmarked several algrithms not only in regression category but also in classification category: 
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest 
* SVM(Support Vector Machine)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Logistic Regression

Let's take a look at briefly each benchmark algorithm:
|Algorithm|Explanation|
|:--------:|:--------|
|Decision Tree|Decision tree can be used to classification and regression both having a tree like structure. In a decision tree building algorithm first the best attribute of dataset is placed at the root, then training dataset is split into subsets. Splitting of data depends on the features of datasets. This process is done until the whole data is classified and we find leaf node at each branch. Information gain can be calculated to find which feature is giving us the highest information gain. Decision trees are built for making a training model which can be used to predict class or the value of target variable.|
|Random Forest|This also can be used for classification as well as regression. Multiple number of decision trees taken together forms a random forest algorithm. Each decision tree includes some rule-based system. For the given training dataset with targets and features, the decision tree algorithm will have set of rules. In random forest unlike decision trees there is no need to calculate information gain to find root node. It use the rules of each randomly created decision tree to predict the outcome and stores the predicted outcome. Further it calculates the vote for each predicted target. Thus high voted prediction is considered as the final prediction from the random forest algorithm.|
|Support Vector Machine|Support vector machine is a binary classifier. Raw data is drawn on the n- dimensional plane. In this a separating hyperplane is drawn to differentiate the datasets. The line drawn from centre of the line separating the two closest data-points of different categories is taken as an optimal hyperplane. This optimised separating hyperplane maximizes the margin of training data. Through this hyperplane, new data can be categorised.|
|Gaussian Naive Bayes| It is a technique for constructing classifiers which is based on Bayes theorem used even for highly sophisticated classification methods. It learns the probability of an object with certain features belonging to a particular group or class. In short, it is a probabilistic classifier. In this method occurrence of each feature is independent of occurrence another feature. It only needs small amount of training data for classification, and all terms can be precomputed thus classifying becomes easy, quick and efficient.|
|Logistic Regression| In logistic regression we have lot of data whose classification is done by building an equation. This method is used to find the discrete dependent variable from the set of independent variables. Its goal is to find the best fit set of parameters. In this classifier, each feature is multiplied by a weight and then all are added. Then the result is passed to sigmoid function which produces the binary output. Logistic regression generates the coefficients to predict a logit transformation of the probability.|

Each benchmark was performed on train data set at first, and then on test set.
Thinking of overfitting due to small data size, I used Scikit Learn's k-fold cross-validation to diminish overfitting and get better results. It randomly splits the training set into k distinct subsets called folds, then it trains and evaluates the model k times, picking a different fold for evaluation every time and training on the other k-1 folds. (I can decide and give the number k to the cross-validation function as a parameter)  
The results are in the following Implementation section.



## III. Methodology


### Data Preprocessing
As I mentioned above, any abnormalities in data set did not found. Furthermore, as there is no categorical variable, we can focus our consideration on preprocessing for numerical variables.  
When we look at the data statistics (see Data Exploration section above) the value scale ranges are different among variables, we need to adjust scale to get more accurate results.  
Scikit learn provides some scaling methods including Standard scaler, MinMax Scaler, and so on.  
I used MinMaxScaler which scales every numerical data into (0, 1).


### Implementation
1. Define Input & Output : As a first step, I defined output(target) variable and input variables for a prediction model.  
Output is "Chance of Admit" and the remaining variables are inputs to be used for the prediction. Among the variables, "Serial No." was dropped.
  
2. Split Train & Test set : Next, I splitted the data set into train and test set. Train set will be used for model implementation and test set will be used for measuring the implemented model's prediction performance for unseen data.
For splitting, I used Scikit learn's train_test_split function with proper argument settings ( test set size to be 20% of data set and random state to be 42 which will be used as a seed by random number generator)  

3. Feature Scaling : To adjust input data scale, I used MinMaxScaler of Scikit Learn.  
This scaler converts every input data (all numeric) into (0, 1) scale. To do this, I applied fit_transform method to train data and transform method to test data.  

4. Now, It's time to fit our train data. I chose Linear Regression algorithm and fit the train data which I splitted in step 2.   
Scikit learn provides many machine learning algorithms. To use linear regression algorithm, I imported LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model. There are not much thing to do after importing. Just calling 'fit' with our train input and label variable is enough to fit our train data. Lastly, I performed prediction with train data input using predict method of LinearRegression.  
I used default hyperparameter setting like this:
    > LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=None, normalize=False)

5. Measure Performance : To measure our prediction model's performance, some metrics are needed. I chose RMSE for measuring my regression model's performance as I mentioned before.  
To use that, I imported mean_squared_error from sckit learn and gave train data label and the prediction result from step 4 as function arguments. And then applied numpy's square root function to get RMSE.
 
6. Compare with test data set : After prediction and measurement with train data, to see the performance of my prediction model on unseen data, I performed prediction and measurement (wth RMSE) again on test data set. If the RMSE of train set is far lower than that of test set, this means overfitting happens. My result was train RMSE: 0.0593 and test RMSE: 0.0608, nearly same two numbers, which means overfitting did not happen in my linear regression model.

7. Benchmark : To benchmark, I tried some other regression algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest. Also, for wider benchmarking I tried some classification algorithms including SVM(Support Vector Machine), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression. To use these classification algorithms I needed to define binary classification label. I divided the target variable - Chance of Admit - into two classes, 1 and 0. When the Chance of Admit is greater than 80%, the data instance is labelled with '1' or else, it is labelled with '0'. For metric I used Sckit learn's score method(the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels) as well as f1 Score(weighted average of the precision and recall)  
The hyperparameters for each benchmark algorithm I used are as follows:
* Decision Tree (random_state=42, and default settings for the others)
    > DecisionTreeRegressor(criterion='mse', max_depth=None, max_features=None,
           max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0,
           min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1,
           min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,
           presort=False, random_state=42, splitter='best')
* Random Forest (n_estimators=100, random_state=42, and defaults for the others)
    > RandomForestRegressor()
* 



8. Benchmark Results : 
* Regression Algorithms Benchmark Results
 
|Algorithm|RMSE(train)|RMSE(test)|
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|Linear Regression|0.0593|0.0608|
|Decision Tree|1.6653e-17|0.0929|
|Random Forest|0.0250|0.0651|

* Classification Algorithms Benchmark Results

|Algorithm|Score|F1 Score|
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|SVM|0.97|0.94|
|Gaussian Naive Bayes|0.93|0.88|
|Decision Tree Classifier|0.95|0.91|
|Random Forest Classifier|0.96|0.92|
|Logistic Regression|0.96|0.92|

9. Try cross validation with different validation sets : I divided the original data set into two groups - train, test set - to train(fit)the model with train set and test the model for unseen data. But overfit problem occurred for some models especially it was serious on decision tree algorithm (RMSE for train set was nearly zero!)  
There can be many reasons that this overfitting problem occurs but the small size of data set is major reason, I think.
To address this, I tried cross validation technique which divides the data set into smaller groups and uses one by one as the validation data set. Scikit learn privides cross_val_score function so I imported it and made 10 subgroups (by setting 'cv' parameter to be 10). I used 'negative mean squared error' as a 'scoring' parameter for cross_val_score function. Scikit learn cross-validation features expect a utility function (greater is beter) rather than a cost function (lower is better), so the scoring function is actually the opposite of the MSE(i.e., a negative value), which is why I used 'negatieve mean squared error' and computed '-scores' before calculating the square root in the code file('capstone.ipynb').  
As cross validation made 10 RMSE values, I calculated mean and standard deviation of them and I repeated this process for three regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.  
The cross validation results are as follows: (RMSE Mean for test data set)  
* [Linear Regression] 0.059
* [Decision Tree] 0.085
* [Random Forest] 0.064
* Comparing to the benchmark results in Implementation section, we can see that they are considerably improved.


### Refinement
I tried to refine the prediction model with hyperparameter tuning. As there is no room for hyperparameter tuning in Linear Regression, I tried with Random Forest algorithm.  
To find out the best hyperparameter combination, I used Grid Search of Scikit Learn. And the next, I also tried Randomized Search to compare the result.  
At first, let's take a look at briefly these two methods:




## IV. Results


### Model Evaluation and Validation
To test my final model, I tried some test data and compared the predicted outputs with labels.(see source code in 'capstone.ipynb')  
The part of results are as follows:  
|Index|Prediction|Real|
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|0|0.91|0.93|
|10|0.72|0.45|
|20|0.67|0.67|
|30|0.56|0.59|
|40|0.97|0.96|
|50|0.89|0.93|
|60|0.63|0.68|
|70|0.62|0.64|
|80|0.77|0.80|
|90|0.74|0.73|
My final model seems to work well and is making reasonable outputs for test(unseen) data.


### Justification
To compare my final model with benchmarks, I repeated the above process: I entered the same input data into the benchmark models and compared the results. (see the source code in 'capstone.ipynb')  
I attached the resulting plot here:
![comparison](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ul4y6jmkcgb1jw/comparison.png?dl=1)
I plotted 3 predictions (LR,DT,RF) and real values(labels) for 10 test data.(Index 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90)  
Except in index 10, Linear Regression model's prediction is closer to the real value or at least nearly same as the other model's predictions.



## V. Conclusion


### Free-Form Visualization
To see feature importance, plotting heatmap is another good choice. Heatmap shows us the correlations among features, so we can determine the most important features by seeing the correlations between the target("Chance of Admit") and the other features(input variables)  
![heatmap](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhagc6hfalifxxk/heatmap.png?dl=1)
From the heatmap, we can see the top three important variables which are highly related to the target variable (Chance of Admit) are CGPA, GRE Score and TOEFL Score, which coincides with what we saw above.



### Reflection
In this project I made a prediction model to predict the 'chance of admit' for a graduate school with some input features including CGPA, GRE score, TOEFL score and so on.  
To make the model I benchmarked many algorithms in regression as well as classification models. For a metric I used RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and used it to meaure the performance of algorithms. After benchmarking I got my final model (Linear Regression model) and tested it with some input data.  
One interesting thing occurred in fitting the train data with Decision Tree algorithm. The metric - RMSE - was nearly zero. At first, I thought there must be some calculation error or parameter setting error, but I came to know it was significant overfitting. To address this overfitting problem, I used Cross Validation which divides the original data set into small groups and use them as validation data. After benchmarks and refinement I came to get my final model. 



### Improvement
The target variable I used in this project was the interviewees' reply (how much possibility(0% ~ 100% range) they expect they got the admission acceptance from the graduate school with there track records (i.e. the features including CGPA, GRE, TOEFL, and so on))  
In other words, the label in this supervised learning problem was not the real results but the interviewees' expectations.  
If I can collect the sufficiently many real acceptance data (Yes or No), and use them as labels I can make more useful prediction model.
