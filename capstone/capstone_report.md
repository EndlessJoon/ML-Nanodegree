## I. Definition


### Project Overview
When graduate schools decide to get new entrants, they consider many records of the applicants including undergraduate GPA, GRE, TOEFL, letters of recommendation and so on. From the Data Science and Machine Learning point of view, by analyzing the admission data and training that, we can make a prediction model to help applicants to concentrate on more important factors which lead them to get the acceptance. 


### Problem Statement
The problem is : "How much I can have confidence that I can get the acceptance from graduate school with my record?" The record includes GPA, GRE score, TOEFL score, and so on.     
The confidence is expressed as a number in range [0, 1]. That is, we can think the confidence as the probability of getting  the acceptance.  
The solution to the problem is the confidence level that the applicants can expect for the graduate admission. The confidence level is a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) so the applicants can think of this as the probability that he or she can get the admission with his or her records(GRE score, TOEFL score,...). I will attempt to solve this problem with various regression models including linear regression, decistion tree, random forest and so on. Furthurmore, I will also try to apply classification algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes.


### Metrics
There are many metrics to measure performance of regression problem including RMSE, R squared and so on:
 * RMSE(Root Mean Square Error): This measures the standard deviation of the errors the system makes in its predictions. Smaller is better.
 * R squared(Coefficient of Determination): This is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Larger is better.  

I will use RMSE for performance measurement.



## II. Analysis


### Data Exploration
&nbsp;I used Graduate Admission dataset from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)  
This dataset contains 9 parameters:
* Serial No. (1 to 500)
* GRE Scores (290 to 340)
* TOEFL Scores (92 to 120)
* University Rating (1 to 5)
* Statement of Purpose (1 to 5)
* Letter of Recommendation Strength (1 to 5)
* Undergraduate CGPA (6.8 to 9.92)
* Research Experience (0 or 1)
* Chance of Admit (0.34 to 0.97)

&nbsp;I'll set 'Chance of Admit' parameter as the label and the remaining parameters as inputs to make a prediction model. Serial No. will be dropped in making the model because it is simply used for indexing purpose.
As I showed in the jupyter notebook ("capstone.ipynb") this set has 400 entries, all variables are numeric (there is no categorical variable) and missing values or abnormalities about data were not found.


### Exploratory Visualization
At first, it is worth seeing data summary statistics as to get overall picture of data:
![dd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7s0pb9of0nwo5iw/dd.JPG?dl=1)  
We can see every variable has 500 entries so there is no missing value in the dataset. And from the mean, standard deviation and the other statistics we can expect there are not abnomalities we should take care of before building up the prediction model.

Next, we can see the correlations among variables through heatmap:
![heatmap](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhagc6hfalifxxk/heatmap.png?dl=1)
From the heatmap, we can see the top three important variables which are highly related to the target variable (Chance of Admit) are CGPA, GRE Score and TOEFL Score.


### Algorithms and Techniques
For the regression problem like this, there are many algorithms which show good performance, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and so on. Though choosing anyone would be good I chose Linear Regression because it is simple, easy to implement and understand. For the other algorithms I used them as benchmarks.  
When I used Linear Regression algorithm, I used "Chance of Admit" as a dependent(target) variable, and the others as independent(input) variables. I implemented all these in the jupyter notebook. ("capstone.ipynb")


### Benchmark

In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
